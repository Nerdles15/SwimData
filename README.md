# SwimcloudScraper
Data scraper for swimcloud

Goal is to pull times and splits from various teams for use in further statistical analysis

So far if you input a team ID (visible publicly on swimcloud), then it will parse a maximum number of meets in the 2024-2025 season (user-defined max) and save all events/swimmers/final times to an excel table, with tabs for each meet.

Still need to get associated splits for each race.
